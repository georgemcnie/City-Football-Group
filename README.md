# City-Football-Group

### Note
Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) signed at the outset of the project with City Football Group (CFG), all outcomes, including the code, results, and resources, are owned by CFG and cannot be shared. However, I am able to provide an in-depth explanation of the technical processes employed and how they addressed the challenges set by CFG.  

### The Project

The project was centered around analysing the loan market in professional football, with the goal of providing insights and trends that could help the City Football Group (CFG) refine their strategies for loaning players. The project was divided into two seperate but not entirely distinct parts. First, an analysis using graph networks was conducted to uncover underlying trends in the loan market between specific clubs. Second, player pathways were analyzed to identify the factors contributing to a successful loan, allowing us to recommend potential strategies for individual players based on their characteristics and profiles. The analysis was conducted on unclean data, requiring significant effort to clean and manipulate various datasets from different sources in order to make them usable for meaningful analysis.

This project was completed in collaboration with my lab partner, with regular weekly meetings with our university supervisor and bi-weekly meetings with an analyst from CFG. The work involved submitting both an interim and final report, as well as presenting and defending our methods and results during a viva. Following this, we presented our findings to CFG's data analysis team, who have since adopted and built upon our work.

### Key technical highlights
